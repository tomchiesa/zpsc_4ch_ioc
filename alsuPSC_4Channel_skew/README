PSC driver usage

Building requires libevent >= 2.0.19.  

Check configure/RELEASE for dependencies: 
Requires EPICS7 
Requires calc-master (for array scaling for waveform records)
Requires seqencer-main (for turn on and turn off state machines for each channel)


In start script:

 createPSC("sessionname", "hostname", 8765, 1)
 dbLoadRecords("db/psc-ctrl.db", "P=TST-MAG{XX}, NAME=sessionname")

Where "hostname" is the host or IP address of the PSC
and 8765 is the port number to connect.
The file 'psc-ctrl.db' contains standard records for connection and
driver status information.

For fourth argument of createPSC is used to enable the recv data timeout.
When this argument is 0 no timeout is set.  When 1 a timeout of PSCInactivityTime
seconds is used.  If no data is received within this time the connection is closed.

The driver will also always timeout if there is data in the socket buffer for more
than PSCInactivityTime seconds.  This should only occur for sustained data rates
in excess of what the server can accept, or if the server stops accepting data.

== Message format ==

The driver sends and receives variable length messages (aka. blocks)
with an 8 bytes header followed a variable length body.
The 'bodylen' field in the header gives the number of bytes
in the body.

struct header {
  char A; /* must be 'P' */
  char B; /* must be 'S' */
  uint16_t msgid;
  uint32_t bodylen; /* in bytes */
};


== Receive ==

To receive a block as an array (waveform).  The block is assumed
to be an array of 2's complement signed 16-bit integers.  It
is stored as floating point numbers to allow for scaling.

record(waveform, "$(P)wfin-I") {
  field(DTYP, "PSC Block I16 In")
  field(INP , "@$(NAME) $(msgid)")
  field(SCAN, "I/O Intr")
  field(FTVL, "DOUBLE")
  field(NELM, "10")
}

The record will be processed whenever a block with message id '$(msgid)'
is received.  On reception up to 20 bytes (2*10) are stored in the record
and the NORD field is set accordingly.

Use DTYP "PSC Block I32 In" to treat as 32-bit integers.

DTYP "PSC Block I8 In" may also be used if FTVL is CHAR or UCHAR.

To receive a block as a group of individual registers.

record(longin, "$(P)regX-I") {
  field(DTYP, "PSC Reg")
  field(INP, "@$(NAME) $(msgid) $(offset)")
  field(SCAN, "I/O Intr")
}

On reception of message id '$(msgid)' this record is processed.  If the
length of the message is less than '$(offset)+4' then the record will
go into alarm (INVALID).  Otherwise the bytes '$(offset)' through '$(offset)+3'
are read, interpreted as a 32-bit integer, and stored in the VAL field.

In addition to 'longin', the record types 'bi', 'mbbi', 'mbbiDirect', and 'ai'
may also be used.

For the 'mbbi*' record types the NOBT and SHFT fields are used to allow
several records to operate on the same offset.  For the bi record type,
the MASK field may be used.


== Send ==

Each PSC socket maintains a send buffer which is flushed on command

record(bo, "$(P)Send-Cmd") {
  field(DTYP, "PSC Ctrl Send All")
  field(DESC, "Send pending to PSC")
  field(OUT , "@$(NAME)")
  field(ZNAM, "Send")
  field(ONAM, "Send")
}


To send an array as a block include a record like:

record(waveform, "$(P)wfout-SP") {
  field(DTYP, "PSC Block I16 Out")
  field(INP , "@$(NAME) $(msgid)")
  field(FTVL, "DOUBLE")
  field(NELM, "10")
  field(FLNK, "$(P)Send-Cmd")
}

Processing this record will cause the array data to be converted to
16-bit integers, formatted into a message, and added to the send buffer.
If the record is FLNK'd to "$(P)Send-Cmd" then the message will be
send immediately.

If the PSC socket is not connected then the record goes into INVALID alarm.

Use DTYP "PSC Block I32 Out" to send as 32-bit integers.

DTYP "PSC Block I8 Out" may also be used if FTVL is CHAR or UCHAR.

To send a group of individual register values as a block.  First
add an entry to the start script.

 setPSCSendBlockSize("sessionname", $(msgid), $(blocksize))

Then create several records.

record(longout, "$(P)regX-I") {
  field(DTYP, "PSC Reg")
  field(OUT, "@$(NAME) $(msgid) $(offset)")
  field(FLNK, "$(P)Q:$(offset)-Cmd_")
}

In addition to 'longout', the record types 'bo', 'mbbo', 'mbboDirect', and 'ao'
may also be used.

This will update an scratch copy of the register block.  Also add a record:

record(longout, "$(P)Q:$(offset)-Cmd_") {
  field(DTYP, "PSC Ctrl Send")
  field(OUT , "@$(NAME)")
  field(VAL , "$(msgid)")
  field(FLNK, "$(P)Send-Cmd")
}

When processed, this will build a message using the current contents of
the scratch copy, and add it to the send buffer.

== Driver Configuration Variables ==

PSCDebug - Controls error and debug messages.

0 - Print as little as possible
1 - Print errors (default)
2 - Print info and messages sent
5 - Full debug info


PSCMaxSendBuffer - Max send buffer size

Defaults to 1MB


PSCInactivityTime - Timeout when nothing send/received for some seconds.

Closes the connection and starts the reconnect timer.
